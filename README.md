This is a sample project accompanying a blogpost on [Pusher's blog](https://blog.pusher.com/making-live-notifications-for-android-using-pusher/). 
It teaches you how to create a simple live notification on Android that will help you to track live bitcoin price with a minimal drain on the battery.
It has 2 components - an Android application that subscribes to notifications via FCM, and a Node server that is making the pushes to it.
